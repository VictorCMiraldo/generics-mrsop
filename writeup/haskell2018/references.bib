abstract="Generic Haskell is an extension of Haskell that supports the construction of generic programs. These lecture notes discuss three advanced generic programming applications: generic dictionaries, compressing XML documents, and the zipper: a data structure used to represent a tree together with a subtree that is the focus of attention, where that focus may move left, right, up or down the tree. When describing and implementing these examples, we will encounter some advanced features of Generic Haskell, such as type-indexed data types, dependencies between and generic abstractions of generic functions, adjusting a generic function using a default case, and generic functions with a special case for a particular constructor.",

year="2014",
abstract="Strong type systems can be used to increase the reliability and performance of programs. In combination with type inference the overhead for the programmer can be kept small. Nevertheless, explicit type signatures often remain needed or useful. In languages with standard Hindley-Milner-based type systems, programmers have a binary choice between omitting the type signature (and rely on type inference) or explicitly providing the type entirely; there are no intermediate options. Proposals for partial type signatures exist, but none support features like local constraints and GHC's non-generalisation of local bindings. Therefore we propose and motivate a practical form of partial type signatures for present-day Haskell. We formally describe our proposal as an extension of the OutsideIn(X) system and prove some of its properties. We have developed a (not yet complete) implementation for the GHC Haskell compiler. Our design fits naturally in both the OutsideIn(X) formalism and the compiler.",

abstract="Generic programming (GP) is a form of abstraction in programming languages that serves to reduce code duplication by exploiting the regular structure of algebraic datatypes. Over the years, several different approaches to GP in Haskell have surfaced. These approaches are often similar, but certain differences make them particularly well-suited for one specific domain or application. As such, there is a lot of code duplication across GP libraries, which is rather unfortunate, given the original goals of GP.",
