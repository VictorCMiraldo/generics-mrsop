Dear Niki, Richard, and Nicolas,

We wanted to let you know that we intend to submit two related papers to 
TyDe and the Haskell Symposium. In accordance with the SIGPLAN Republication 
Policy, we're writing you now to clarify the relationship between these two papers:

  i) Sums of Products for Mutually Recursive Datatypes (TyDe)
  ii) Generic Programming of All Kinds (Haskell Symp.)

We've attached a preliminary draft of both papers to this email. 
The first paper i), was unfortunately rejected from ICFP. Although both papers 
explore generic programming in Haskell, there are substantial differences:

  a) Paper (i) handles mutually recursive types, paper (ii) does not.
  b) Paper (ii) handles GADTs and existentials, paper (i) does not.
  c) Paper (i) presents a library available for consumption. 
     In contrast, paper (ii) is more theoretical, and describes a general 
     technique one could use to write another library.
  d) Paper (ii) carries some Agda proofs of consistency; paper (i) does 
     not require those since it does not need 'TypeInType'.

We hope that you will not object to these simultaneous submissions. 
If you have any further questions, feel free to get in touch,

Sincerely,
Victor Miraldo and Alejandro Serrano
