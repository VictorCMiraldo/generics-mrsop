Dear Niki Vazou, Richard Eisenberg, and Nicolas Wu,

We are submitting two apparently similar
papers to both TyDe and Haskell Symposium. 
You can find both drafts attached. 

  i)  Sums of Products for Mutually Recursive Datatypes (TyDe)
  ii) Generic Programming of All Kinds (Haskell Symp.)

In addition, (i) has been previously submitted to ICFP,
and improved with many suggestions from reviewers.

These two papers are significantly different, however.
% Alejandro: I don't really lke this
% In fact, 
% paper (ii) arose from work we have done after submitting paper
% (i) to ICFP, while we tried to address the issues it had. 
% In fact, it is the continuation of paper (i).
The differences can be summarized as:

  a) Paper (i) handles mutually recursive types, paper (ii) does not.
  b) Paper (ii) handles GADTs and existentials, paper (i) does not.
  c) Paper (i) presents a library available for consumption.
     In contrast, paper (ii) is more theoretical, and describes a general
     technique one could use to write another library.
  e) Paper (ii) carries some Agda proofs of consistency; paper (i) does not
     require those since it does not need 'TypeInType'.

We hope that this e-mail will clarify any potential doubt that 
might arise during the PC meetings. 

Sincerely,
Victor Miraldo and Alejandro Serrano
