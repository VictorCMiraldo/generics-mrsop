Dear Niki Vazou, Richard Eisenberg and Nicolas Wu,

We are submitting to apparently similar
papers to both TyDe and the Haskell Symposium. 
You can find both drafts attached. 

  i)  Mutually Recursive Sums-of-Products (TyDe)
  ii) Generic Programming of All Kinds (Haskell Symp.)

These two papers are significantly different, however. In fact, 
paper (ii) arose from work we have done after submitting paper
(i) to ICFP, while we tried to address the issues it had. 
In fact, it is the continuation of paper (i).

The differences can be summarized in:

  a) Paper (i) handles mutually recursive types. Paper (ii) does not.
  b) Paper (ii) handles GADTs and existentials, paper (i) does not.
  c) Paper (i) presents a library available for consumption.
  d) Paper (ii) is more theoretical, and describes a general technique one
  could use to write another library.
  e) Paper (ii) carries some Agda proofs of consistency; paper (i) does not require
  those since it does not need 'TypeInType'.

We hope that this e-mail will clarify any potential doubt that 
might arise during the PC meetings. 

Sincerely,
Victor Miraldo and Alejandro Serrano
